INTENDED USE
------------

The code in this release provides a 'sneak peek' at features to be included in the
upcoming Zend Framework 1.5 release and is not intended for production use. Please be
aware that the API's introduced in this release may not be final, and that the Zend
Framework team does not guarantee backwards compatibility to this release in future
releases of Zend Framework. Some of the code included in the library folder for this
release is currently under development in the incubator repository. Inclusion in this
release for such components and features does not necessarily imply inclusion for a
production release of Zend Framework. We strongly discourage the use of this preview
release in production environments or for projects that could not easily be
refactored to work with future releases of Zend Framework. We strongly recommend
evaluating these features for use in future projects, however, and would appreciate
any feedback.
